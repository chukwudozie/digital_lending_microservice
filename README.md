# Digital Lending Microservice

## A simple microservice to mimic a digital lending platform.

### A customer can request a loan offer and be presented with one or more loan offers based on the customer loan maximum qualification. From the offers presented, a customer can choose and accept  one of the offers.
### When a customer accepts an offer, then we will credit his mobile wallet.
